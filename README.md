# Redesigned Fan Shroud for LulzBot Taz 3D Printer
![Graph](img/assembly.png)

A redesigned fan shroud for the LulzBot HE tool head found on my Taz Workhorse 3D printer.

Probably (?) fits other tool heads too, but is not compatible with the other tool head I own, the HS+.

I modified the existing design to allow the heater block to turn the entire 360 degrees without interference from the fan shroud. 
I've been using this part for more than two years without problem.

I used the original STL files from LulzBot to read off the exact locations of mating planes and mounting points; otherwise the design is original.

This repository contains both the Solidworks models and STL files for the parts.

A rather rough-looking example printed in nylon-CF. I used ABS for the final print.
